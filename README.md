# Functional Kotlin
This is the code repository for [Functional Kotlin](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/functional-kotlin?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788476485), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Functional programming makes your application faster, improves performance, and increases your productivity. Kotlin supports many of the popular and advanced functional features of functional languages. This book will cover the A-Z of functional programming in Kotlin. This book bridges the language gap for Kotlin developers by showing you how to create and consume functional constructs in Kotlin. We also bridge the domain gap by showing how functional constructs can be applied in business scenarios. We’ll take you through lambdas, pattern matching, immutability, and help you develop a deep understanding of the concepts and practices of functional programming. If you want learn to address problems using Recursion, Koltin has support for it as well. You’ll also learn how to use the funKtionale library to perform currying and lazy programming and more. Finally, you’ll learn functional design patterns and techniques that will make you a better programmer.By the end of the book, you will be more confident in your functional programming skills and will be able to apply them while programming in Kotlin.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

All chapters have codes.

The code will look like the following:
```
open class BakeryGood(val flavour: String) { 
  fun eat(): String { 
    return "nom, nom, nom... delicious $flavour bakery good" 
  } 
}
```

The only recommended software to run and write Kotlin programs is IntelliJ IDEA. You can install IntelliJ IDEA on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
